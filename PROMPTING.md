# Prompting Guide

## Style Template

[Subject]
- user request distilled into a clear scene

[Coloring-book constraints — ALWAYS present]
- "black-and-white coloring book page"
- "outline-only line art, clean bold contours"
- "NO color fill, NO grayscale, NO shading, NO gradients"
- "printable, lots of open spaces for coloring"
- "avoid photorealism, avoid 3D render, avoid halftone, avoid crosshatching shading"

[Girly glam style — vary by sliders]
- "glam, sparkly, rhinestone-dot outlines"
- "hearts, bows, stars, diamonds, gem outlines"
- "beauty doodles: lipstick, lashes, nails, heels"
- "snazzy high-fashion, playful, glamorous border (if enabled)"

[Composition controls]
- density mapping (simple/medium/busy)
- line thickness mapping (thin/medium/thick)
- border style mapping

## Negative Prompt (always include)

"color, colored, grayscale, grey, shading, shadow, gradient, photorealistic, 3d, render, crosshatching, hatching, halftone, painterly, texture fill"

## Good Examples

- A glam kitten wearing a bow, surrounded by sparkles and hearts, with thick outlines and lots of open space for coloring.
- A fashion runway scene with shoes and makeup doodles, outlined in bold black line art with a simple border.

## Bad Outputs (avoid)

- Shaded pencil sketches, grayscale gradients, or filled color regions.
- Photorealistic portraits or 3D renders.
- Dense crosshatching that removes open coloring space.
