# Lessons Learned

Short, dated entries capturing pitfalls, surprises, and fixes.

## 2026-01-22
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: Secret management for local development.
- Lesson: Do not store or echo secrets; use a local `.env` that is ignored by git.
- Action: Add `.env.example`, add `.env` to `.gitignore`, and verify presence without printing values.

## 2026-01-22
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: Docs-only governance changes.
- Lesson: Governance updates still need a micro plan and evidence even without code changes.
- Action: Record micro plan/self-critique entries in `DECISIONS.md` with diff commands.

## 2026-01-22
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: Contract validation for SpecValidationSeam.
- Lesson: Validation seams must accept raw/invalid inputs; strict schemas block fault fixtures.
- Action: Add a raw spec schema for input and validate against the strict schema inside the adapter.

## 2026-01-22
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: TypeScript with verbatim module syntax.
- Lesson: Type-only imports are required for types used only in annotations.
- Action: Split value and type imports using `import type` to keep svelte-check green.

## 2026-01-22
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: Prompt template alignment and decoration rules.
- Lesson: Prompt template changes must be reflected in fixtures and drift checks immediately or contract tests will fail silently later.
- Action: Update prompt fixtures and add alignment phrase checks alongside template edits.

## 2026-01-22
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: Forbidden token detection in drift checks.
- Lesson: Internal prompt lines (e.g., “Font style: …”) can trip forbidden token scans if not explicitly excluded.
- Action: Sanitize drift detection token scans to ignore allowed lines while keeping provider-parameter checks intact.

## 2026-01-22
- Date: 2026-01-22
- Context: Renderer feature expansion (decorations/illustrations/shading).
- Lesson: Each new visual mode needs a deterministic fixture + adapter assertion so layout changes are provable, not assumed.
- Action: Add dense/scene fixtures and contract tests alongside renderer updates.

## 2026-01-23
- Date: 2026-01-23
- Context: Evidence reporting for non-coders.
- Lesson: Keep enforcement deterministic and let summaries be interpretive; never let summaries decide pass/fail.
- Action: Generate ledger and proof tape reports as supplemental evidence artifacts.

## 2026-01-23
- Date: 2026-01-23
- Context: Seam readiness communication.
- Lesson: A clean/dirty view helps non-coders track readiness, but it must stay derived from deterministic ledger data.
- Action: Add a clan chain report that reads seam ledger output only.

## 2026-01-23
- Date: 2026-01-23
- Context: Proof-summary enforcement.
- Lesson: A short cipher summary tied to evidence helps prevent silent drift without weakening enforcement.
- Action: Add cipher gate tooling and document the required cipher fields in `DECISIONS.md`.

## 2026-01-23
- Date: 2026-01-23
- Context: Blocked-probe visibility.
- Lesson: A deterministic assumption gate prevents hidden uncertainty from leaking into production decisions.
- Action: Add assumption alarm tooling and standard assumption fields in `DECISIONS.md`.

## 2026-01-23
- Date: 2026-01-23
- Context: Automated enforcement.
- Lesson: Local hooks + CI keep verification consistent without relying on memory.
- Action: Add `hooks:install` and a CI workflow that runs `npm run verify`.

## 2026-01-23
- Date: 2026-01-23
- Context: Deterministic Meechie tools.
- Lesson: Template-driven responses need explicit failure conditions for fault fixtures to stay meaningful.
- Action: Enforce lineup minimums in the adapter and reflect them in fixtures/tests.

## 2026-01-24
- Date: 2026-01-24
- Context: External probes with network restrictions.
- Lesson: DNS or network failures are indistinguishable from missing credentials unless explicitly captured.
- Action: Record blocked probes in `DECISIONS.md` and capture failing probe output under `docs/evidence/` to keep the block explicit.

## 2026-01-25
- Date: 2026-01-25
- Context: Optional share exports vs print output.
- Lesson: Share variants must be generated without changing print fidelity; keep share resizing isolated inside OutputPackagingSeam.
- Action: Add explicit export variants and keep print outputs unchanged.

## 2026-01-26
- Date: 2026-01-26
- Context: xAI image prompt constraints and governance clarity.
- Lesson: Canonical prompts must stay within provider limits or nothing works; governance docs need explicit AI guidance/checklists to keep autonomous agents honest.
- Action: Shorten the prompt template to under 1024 characters, update drift + fixture + probe text accordingly, and add AI-agent reference notes plus a detailed checklist for every future plan.
